# NutriTrack - Nutrition Tracking Assistant

This is the code for the NutriTrack app, developed over the course of a weekend for ArchHacks 2017. It uses convolutional neural nets to classify images of food you're eating, logs the food and relevant nutrition facts, and uses your total daily intake to make recipe suggestions based on your nutritional deficiency. This project won *Best Nutritional Product* at ArchHacks 2017 in St. Louis.
